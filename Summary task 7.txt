In this task, a synthetic Superstore dataset with 500 records and 6 features was pre-processed and stored in an SQLite database using Python. SQL queries were applied to summarise sales performance, calculating total quantity sold and revenue by product category. The results were displayed in tabular form and visualised through a matplotlib bar chart, providing a clear overview of category-wise sales trends.
